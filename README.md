We designed a dynamic mobile application for the university campus to detect location of a
user using MAC address of Wifi-AP and provide relevant services to the user based upon his current location.
The Application is built using Java and Firebase.
We build the app using an iterative process by designing mocks for the UI and then planning the backend and front-end design.
